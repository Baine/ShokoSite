# Overview
This repo is for the [Shoko Website](https://shokoanime.com) which is used for providing news and information in regard to the Shoko suite of programs and plugins. 

# Adding New Content
Anyone working on a program or plugin that utilizes Shoko is more than welcome to create a news post and/or create an entry for the program/plugin. However, we do not allow announcement type or coming soon posts and require at the very minimum an MVP of the program/plugin that is also available for a download.
