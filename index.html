				<h1>Automate Your Anime Collection</h1>

				<p>Shoko, previously known as JMM (Japanese Media Manager) is an anime cataloging program designed to automate the cataloging of your anime
					collection regardless of the size and number of files in your collection, it’s even able to connect with some of the most popular media
					center programs out there. Unlike other anime cataloging programs which rely on perfectly named files or force you to manually link the file
					with a series and episode, Shoko does this all automatically with minimal user intervention. Let Shoko do all the heavy lifting by removing
					these tedious and time consuming tasks so you actually watch your collection instead of just maintaining it.
				</p>

				<h1>Open-Source and Free</h1>

				<p>With Shoko it was decided in the very beginning that Shoko will always remain free with no “Pro” version or donation requests, we don’t even
					take donations as we don’t want there to be any question as to where the money is going. We also offer complete transparency with our users
					hosting the entire Shoko Suite on GitHub for anyone to view and even help develop. The reason we do this is simple, we want to provide the
					best anime cataloging / anime manager program there is at no cost to the our users. Passion and support is what fuels us and our continued
					drive for constant improvement.
