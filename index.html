				<h1>Automate Your Anime Collection</h1>

				<p>Shoko, previously known as JMM (Japanese Media Manager) is an anime cataloging program designed to automate
					the entire process of cataloging your anime collection regardless of of the size and number of files in your
					collection. Where other anime cataloging programs rely on perfectly named files or force you to manually link
					a file to the correct episode, Shoko does this all automatically with minimal user intervention. Let Shoko do
					all the heavy lifting by removing these tedious and time consuming tasks so you actually watch your
					collection instead of just maintaining it.
				</p>

				<h1>Incredibly Easy To Use</h1>

				<p>Import your entire collection in just two steps by simply adding your import folders and clicking run
					import.
				</p>

				<p>We're not kidding when we say we designed Shoko to be as easy to use as possible. What's the point of
					removing the tedious processes other cataloging programs make you do if we just add our own? Of course we
					also provide a ton of options for advanced users allowing each user to have their desired setup.

				<h1 class = "section-header-light">How Does Shoko Really Work?</h1>

				<p>Shoko hashes each file in your collection and sends the hash to AniDB for comparison. When a match is found,
					the series is created in your database and metadata from supported data gathering sites is downloaded and
					compiled for use within Shoko providing detailed information about each file and its associated series. In
					the rare chance there ever is a problem with the automated process, Shoko includes a wide array of advanced
					tools to identify and properly catalog any file that was unable to be automatically processed.
				</p>

				<h1 class = "section-header-light">Making Life Easier With Shoko Desktop</h1>

				<p>Shoko Desktop provides a visual view of your collection creating your own personal tailored anime database.
					From here, users can see what episodes they are missing, individual and get recommendations based on watch
					you've watched. Shoko Desktop also provides an array of utilities to deal with any issues present in your
					collection such as multiple or duplicate files or unrecognized files.
