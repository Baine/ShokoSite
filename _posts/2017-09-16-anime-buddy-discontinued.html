Over the past couple of months, we&#8217;ve been asked about the development status of Anime Buddy. While we originally intended to keep updating it, multiple issues have made this near impossible for us without essentially creating a brand new program. Anime Buddy has not received any updates in years and with the major changes we&#8217;ve made in the past couple of versions, we&#8217;d be looking at a near rewrite of Anime Buddy to just get it functional again. However the bigger issue is we don&#8217;t have access to the Windows Store so there would be no way for current users of Anime Buddy to update to a newer version.&nbsp;Because its was also planned and publicly talked about at one point, there was a possibly of a successor in the form of a smartphone app down the line, however at this time we have no plans to do that.&nbsp;

The Anime Buddy product page has been updated to reflect this announcement, all resources will remain up but will be eventually removed.&nbsp;

Thank you to everyone who used Anime Buddy over the years!
