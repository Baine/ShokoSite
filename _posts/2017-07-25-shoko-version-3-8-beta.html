Hello Everyone!

After seven months of development, we&#8217;re close to releasing the next version of Shoko, Version 3.8! Looking back at our past releases, this upcoming version is by far the biggest release we&#8217;ve done so far. However with that being said, Version 3.8 is not really as feature packed as one might think based off the claim I just made, instead the majority of work has been to optimizing Server and Desktop code as these are essential to our overall goal of making Shoko Server cross-platform and the building of the new Shoko Desktop, currently codename ClientV2.&nbsp;

Our daily users have done a lot of testing and we feel we&#8217;re close to an official release which means it&#8217;s time for a public beta! As usual head on over to our [Beta&nbsp;Page](https://shokoanime.com/beta) for the download link and to see what known issues are present in this beta. If everything goes accordingly, we&#8217;re expecting to run this beta for&nbsp;**one week** and then release.

I won&#8217;t be going into the changes in this post, you&#8217;ll have to wait for the official release post. In the meantime check out the [Changelog](http://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html)&nbsp;for a complete listing of everything that&#8217;s been added, updated, fixed and removed.
