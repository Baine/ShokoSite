<p>This release will be the last release for version 3.8 as we're starting to work on some major internal changes that we've been planning for awhile. There are
	a couple features and issues we wanted to address for this release but we're unable to, as such they will be included in the next major release which
	currently has no date.
</p>

<p>For a complete list of changes, check out the <a href = "http://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">Changelog</a>.
</p>

<h3>Shoko Desktop 2 Preivew</h3>

<p>While pretty barebones, we wanted to give users a taste of the next version of Shoko Desktop we've been working on. Very soon we'll be starting to talk about
	this new version showcasing the changes and planned features but for now, give it a try yourself.
</p>

<p>Like the WebUI, use your Shoko account to login. At the moment, the group section is the only working section but yo can view the Series Info page on a
	series.
</p>


<h3>Shoko Docs Revamp</h3>
<p>We've revamped Shoko Docs cleaning the layout up and hopefully making it easier to navigate. As Shoko Docs is an ongoing project, we'll continue to make
	changes as needed and add new content as time allows.
