This release will be the last release for version 3.8 as we&#8217;re starting to work on some major internal changes that we&#8217;ve been planning for awhile. There are a couple features and issues we wanted to address for this release but we&#8217;re unable to, as such they will be included in the next major release which currently has no date.&nbsp;

For a complete list of changes, check out the <a href="http://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changelog</a>.

## ClientV2 Preivew

While pretty barebones, we wanted to give users a taste of the next version of Shoko Desktop we&#8217;ve been working on. Very soon we&#8217;ll be starting to talk about this new version showcasing the changes and planned features but for now, give it a try yourself.&nbsp;

Like the WebUI, use your Shoko account to login. At the moment, the group section is the only working section but yo can view the Series Info page on a series.&nbsp;

## Shoko Docs Revamp

We&#8217;ve revamped Shoko Docs cleaning the layout up and hopefully making it easier to navigate. As Shoko Docs is an ongoing project, we&#8217;ll continue to make changes as needed and add new content as time allows.&nbsp;
