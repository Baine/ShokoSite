<p>As many of you have probably already heard, Kyoto Animation, creators of such anime as Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid,
	The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and A Silent Voice suffered a horrific arson attack yesterday that
	killed 33 people, with many more injured. This is the largest terror attack in Japan since 2001, and obviously
	extends far beyond the anime community.</p>

<p>American licensing company <a href="https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/" target="_blank">Sentai Filmworks</a> have
	created a GoFundMe that we encourage all anime fans to donate to help those affected by this tragic event. </p>
