<p>Shoko Version 3.9.4 is now available for download!
</p>

<p>This release addresses various bugs reported since the last update that we felt needed addressing before the next major version. This version also
	contains a big change which we've addressed below.
</p>

<p>For a complete list of changes, check out the <a href = "https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html" target = "_blank"
		rel = "noopener">Changelog</a>.
</p>

<h3>Shoko Analytics</h3>
<p>One of the bigger changes we were going to introduce in version 4.0 was the inclusion of a telemetry service. However we didn't want it to get
	buried by the other features and changes coming with version 4.0 so instead we added a basic version of it into version 3.9.4. With telemetry
	services being a hot topic these days we wanted to fully explain our reasons for adding it and what data we'll be collecting to avoid any confusion
	going forward.
</p>

<p>Shoko Server is a massive program and will only continue to grow and while we generate logs with data related to Shoko Server's operations, however
	these logs are only useful to use when provided by our users. Therefore the data we'll be collecting will allow us to target specific issues, add/or
	update popular features and re-tool less popular ones. Furthermore, <strong>all data collected is non-identifiable.</strong> We don't care about
	what specific titles you have in your collection or what you watch. We only care about making Shoko better.
</p>
