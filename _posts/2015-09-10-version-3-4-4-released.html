<p>Version 3.4.4 introduces the following changes.</p>

<h3>Metro Dashboard</h3>
<a href = "{{ 'assets/images/blog/2015-09-10-version-3-4-4-released/JMM-Desktop-Metro-Series-Overview.jpg' | absolute_url }}" data-lightbox = "image-1"
		data-title = "JMM Desktop - Metro Series Overview"><img class = "blog-post-image"
		src = "{{ 'assets/images/blog/2015-09-10-version-3-4-4-released/JMM-Desktop-Metro-Series-Overview.jpg' | absolute_url }}"
		alt = "JMM Desktop - Metro Series Overview"></a>

<p>The series display in the Metro dashboard has received a few small tweaks.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A button has been added to refresh this series</li>
	<li>The previous episode you watch is now shown, so you can re-watch it easily, or just in case you accidentally marked it as watched</li>
	<li>The next episode to watch is highlighted and shows a few more details than other episodes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trakt</h3>
<a href = "{{ 'assets/images/blog/2015-09-10-version-3-4-4-released/JMM-Desktop-Trakt-Settings.jpg' | absolute_url }}" data-lightbox = "image-1"
		data-title = "JMM Desktop - Trakt Settings"><img class = "blog-post-image"
		src = "{{ 'assets/images/blog/2015-09-10-version-3-4-4-released/JMM-Desktop-Trakt-Settings.jpg' | absolute_url }}" lt = "JMM Desktop - Trakt Settings"></a>

<p>The major focus of this release has been adding support for Version 2.0 of the Trakt API. For the last 6-9 months this has been broken in JMM. Most of this
	is invisible to the user, but a few things will be different and are detailed below. Trakt now uses OAuth to verify your credentials, and you are no longer
	required to enter your login/password into JMM. Once Trakt is enabled, simply click on
	the "Get PIN" link, and this will re-direct you to the Trakt website, and you will given a temporary PIN as shown below.
</p>

<a href = "{{ 'assets/images/blog/2015-09-10-version-3-4-4-released/JMM-Desktop-Trakt-OAuth.jpg' | absolute_url }}" ata-lightbox = "image-1"
		data-title = "JMM Desktop - Trakt OAuth"><img class = "blog-post-image"
		src = "{{ 'assets/images/blog/2015-09-10-version-3-4-4-released/JMM-Desktop-Trakt-OAuth.jpg' | absolute_url }}" alt = "JMM Desktop - Trakt OAuth"></a>

<p>Copy and paste this PIN into the text box in JMM Desktop, and then hit "Authorize JMM". At this point JMM stores a token which it can use to start sending
	data to Trakt. Since Trakt has not been working for such a long time, you will probably find that a lot of your Trakt data is not valid anymore.
</p>

<a href = "{{ 'assets/images/blog/2015-09-10-version-3-4-4-released/JMM-Desktop-Community-Data.jpg' | absolute_url }}" ata-lightbox = "image-1"
		data-title = "JMM Desktop - Community Tab"><img class = "blog-post-image"
		src = "{{ 'assets/images/blog/2015-09-10-version-3-4-4-released/JMM-Desktop-Community-Data.jpg' | absolute_url }}" alt = "JMM Desktop - Community Tab"></a>

<h3>Community Data</h3>
<p>A new utility has been added to help fix this data.</p>

<p>Step 1 - Select the first 2 check boxes and Press Start. This will check with Trakt that your exist data is correct, if it is not it will be removed from
	your local database.
</p>

<p>Step 2 - Un-check the first 2 check boxes and select the third "Check if my links are different from Community Recommendations". This will check the links
	you have selected against what the admins have selected as the correct links You can then filter the list to see what series are missing a link entirely or
	differ from the recommendation..
</p>

<p>NOTE - This can take quite a while depending on the number of series you have. It also has the benefit of updating your existing data.
</p>
