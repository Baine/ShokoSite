<p>Shoko Version 3.9.7 is now available for download!
</p>

<p>We've been hard at on some of the items we previously mentioned in <a
	href="https://shokoanime.com/blog/whats-next-for-shoko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What's Next For Shoko</a>
</p> and wanted to release this feature packed release as it might be awhile before the next release.

<p>This release contains many fixes and improvements to the AniDB system, TvDB System and TvDB image downloading. We've
	also tweaked the Sentry settings to stop it from spamming the logs. </p>

<p>The Web UI also got some much needed TLC and users are now able to pause, start and cancel queues.</p>

<p>As always you can find a summary of the changes made by checking out the Changelog.</p>
