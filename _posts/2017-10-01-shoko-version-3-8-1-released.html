Almost a month later and we&#8217;re back with another update!

Version 3.8 was our biggest release to date and was released a very long time after Version 3.7. We&#8217;ve decided that going forward we&#8217;re going to aim for releasing updates at least once a month to ease migration for current users and reduce the amount of testing needed beforehand. We&#8217;ve also made some changes to our versioning system which we&#8217;ve outlined below.&nbsp;

This release mainly focused on fixing issues caused by the previous release as well as adding better logging in both Server and Desktop. As always check the <a href="http://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changelog </a>for a complete list of changes made.

## Shoko On Plex Updated

We&#8217;ve updated Shoko on Plex making it compatible with the latest version of Shoko. This was a maintenance release so please report any issues you encounter on GitHub.&nbsp;

## Changes to Versioning

We&#8217;ve decided to change our versioning system a bit.

Going forward we&#8217;ll only be using a&nbsp;**three-digit** number for releases, the only time the&nbsp;**fourth&nbsp;digit** will be used is for dailies and beta release. This new versioning method will work better with our updated release schedule as we plan to only update the&nbsp;**MINOR number** when we&#8217;ve made a big changed or introduced a new feature.&nbsp;

For those confused here&#8217;s the breakdown.&nbsp;

Example: 3.8.1

  1. MAJOR version number, only updated when significant changes are made.&nbsp;
  2. MINOR version number, updated when a significant feature is added.&nbsp;
  3. PATCH version number, when general changes are made.,
