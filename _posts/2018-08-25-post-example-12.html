<p>After a couple months of extensive testing, the latest version of Shoko has been released!</p>

<p>This release contains a lot of new and updated features and bug fixes making it one of our biggest updates in quite some time. While we initially tried
	to stay away from big releases, some outside factors such as MAL unexpectedly shutting down their API (more below) and our revamped TvDB Linking System
	delayed this release.
</p>

<p>As usual, weâ€™ll cover the big changes below but for a complete list of changes, check out the Changelog.</p>

<h3>New TvDB Linking System</h3>

<p>One of the big changes users will see in Desktop 2, our replacement for the current Shoko Desktop, is a fine-tuned Community Sites System providing users
	with control over every aspect of series linking. While Desktop 2 is still in development, a part of this updated system has been brought into current
	Desktop, the TvDB Linking System. Previously, TvDB linking worked by selecting the starting point and having Shoko match each entry between AniDB and TvDB
	in sequential order. This leads to issues with mismatched episodes and specials due to either AniDB or TvDB having the entries listed in a different order
	leading to additional one-off links needed to correct this. With the new TvDB Linking System, starting points are no longer used and instead each episode
	and special on AniDB is matched with is corresponding entry on TvDB using the provided air dates.
