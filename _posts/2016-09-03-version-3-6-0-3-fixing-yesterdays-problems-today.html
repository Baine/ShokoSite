<p>We've released a maintenance update for JMM, version 3.6.0.3 that fixes JMM Server and Desktop crashing that was reported shortly after the release of
	3.6.0.2. Just goes to show that even with a month long public beta and rigorous internal testing all it takes is that one unique setup to present us with a
	bug we never encountered.

<p>Download links have been updated, you can also check the changelog for additional information.

<p>Luckily we had our trusty Norris Debugger going.
