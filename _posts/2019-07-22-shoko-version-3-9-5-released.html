<p>This release addresses various bugs reported since the last update that we felt needed addressing while we continue

	Changelog.

<h3>What's Next For Shoko</h3>
<p>We get asked quite often what's being worked on at the moment or when a certain feature that's been mentioned before
	will be released. So in order to somewhat answer these questions and just outline our general plans to the community,
	we'll be posting a road map of sorts later this week. If there's something in particular you've seen mentioned before
	but haven't heard about in awhile, DM <strong>Elemental Crisis</strong> for a possible update.</p>
