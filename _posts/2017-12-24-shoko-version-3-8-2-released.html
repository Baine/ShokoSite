<p>Right in time for Christmas, Shoko Version 3.8.2 has been released!

<p>This release was mainly focused on fixing bugs discovered since the previous release and making the entire Shoko process smoother and easier to use.
	Utilities now load much quicker and random quirks with tags, seasons and filters have been fixed.&nbsp;

<h3>My Anime 3 Support For Version 3.8</h3>
<p>First, thank you to all our My Anime 3 users for being patient while waiting for this release, more work was needed then we realized to get My Anime 3
	working with Shoko Version 3.8 causing a lot of delays with this release. <strong>You'll need to first update to version 3.8.2 for it to work.</strong>
</p>

<p>Make sure to send your thanks to MaxPiva who spent many hours updating and fixing bugs in My Anime 3.
