We’ve released a maintenance update, version 3.7.0.4 for the following programs/plugins.

– Shoko Server
  
– Shoko Desktop
  
– Shoko on Plex

This maintenance update focuses on fixing various bugs that have been reported since we released 3.7.0.0. Assuming there are no new program breaking bugs, this will be the last maintenance release for this cycle. Also please be aware, while Shoko on Plex is listed as being updated, there is no new plugin to download as all of its changes were done in Shoko Server.

For detailed information on what was fixed, please check the changelog.
