				<h1>The Early Years</h1>

				<p> In July of 2006, <strong>lwerndly</strong> publicly released his personal AniDB client, AniDB Monitor giving AniDB members the ability to
					automatically hash their files for comparison, add them to their AniDB Mylist and allowed users to update their episode watched states with
					ease. Development on predecessor however halted shortly after AniDB Monitor’s initial release having reached the initial goals of the
					program. Development on AniDB Monitor would remain dormant until 2008 when a user on the MediaPortal forums announced they had begun working
					on an anime plugin simply known as <strong>My Anime</strong>. Demand for such a plugin to allow users to view and watch their anime
					collection was high and many users followed development on the plugin, however for unknown reasons the original developer abandoned the
					project to the dismay of many and once again the MediaPortal community was left without a suitable anime plugin. lwerndly, who had also been
					following the development of the plugin announced he was going to develop his own plugin and using AniDB Monitor as a base was able to
					quickly produce a release. On February 13th, 2008 the MediaPortal plugin <strong>My Anime</strong> was released to the public, this also
					signified the start of what would later become the <strong> JMM Suite</strong>.
				</p>

				<p> The plugin quickly become a very popular with requests and bugs coming in almost faster than lwerndly could implement them. A lot of the
					requests and even some of the bugs reported were the result of the quick release and combination of various parts of AniDB Monitor.
					Development continued forward with various parts being updated or rewritten as time went on eventually leading to the release
					of <a href = "https://forum.team-mediaportal.com/threads/my-anime-2.60793/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">My Anime 2</a> on June 2nd,
					2009 containing a lot of improvements and additions over it’s predecessor. Like usual development continued on and as My Anime 2's
					popularity continued to grow it slowly started to outgrow being just a MediaPortal plugin and the idea of My Anime becoming something more
					started to transition to reality.

				<h1 class = "section-header-light">The JMM Suite</h1>

				<p>As development continued on My Anime 2 and the plugin became more and more popular, the focus started to shift from a collection manager to a
					content consumer. Additionally, the ability to have access to a user's anime collection outside of MediaPortal was becoming more requested
					as users wanted a database that didn't rely on MediaPortal. At the time, there was no centralized database so developing a plugin for
					another program or even a standalone program would require it’s own database and a way to share data between the two. To avoid this and to
					allow any program or plugin access to the database, it was decided that all server functionality would be moved out of My Anime 3 and into
					it’s own then unnamed program. However with the project now growing, a new name to encompass the current My Anime 2 plugin and the then
					unnamed server program was needed, the name <strong>Otaku Media Manager</strong> was selected and development on the standalone server
					program pressed forward.
				</p>

				<p>With <a class="color-link-alt" href = "https://forum.team-mediaportal.com/threads/my-anime-3.107475/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">My Anime 3's</a> release on
					April 19th, 2012, users were introduced to early builds of what would later become Shoko Server and Shoko Desktop. As development continued
					on the three items and with the addition of a Plex plugin, a new name was decided on that better reflected the programs new direction,
					<strong>Japanese Media Manager</strong>. Development continued on with new features being added and new members joining the team culminating
					in a Kodi plugin being developed and the start of some of the heavier tasks on the ever growing to-do list.

				<h1>Shoko</h1>

				<p>Due to personal reasons, <strong>lwerndly</strong> had decided to take less active role with the project and gave leadership
					to <strong>MaxPiva</strong> and <strong>Elemental Crisis</strong>. With a revitalized effort, the still JMM team added new members and began
					working on some of the bigger issues such as SQLite speed and more importantly Linux Support. It was also decided that a new name was needed
					as
					the original name was causing confusion on what exactly JMM did and did not do. The common misconception was that because of the name, users
					assumed JMM supported other types of Japanese media such as Manga and/or J-Drama which was never the original intended goal. In fact, the
					original name of the program was <strong>Anime Media Manager</strong> but was only changed to Japanese Media Manager when one of the
					original
					staff members wanted to include support for manga. Due to personal circumstances, that staff member was never able to add support for it.
					After
					a long discussion on name choices, <strong>da3dsoul</strong> suggested the
					name <a href = "http://localhost:4000/blog/jmm-is-now-shoko-version-3-7-beta/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">Shoko</a> which ended up
					being
					the only name the entire staff was able to agree on.
