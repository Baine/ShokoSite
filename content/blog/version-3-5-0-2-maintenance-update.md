We've discovered a bug with our installer script that caused required files to not be included during the build process. We've released an update to fix this issue, all users who previously installed version 3.5.0.1 should download this release. 

We've also pulled the latest version of Shoko on Plex and replaced it with the previous version while we investigate some newly discovered bugs.
