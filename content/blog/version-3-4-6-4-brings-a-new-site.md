Hello Everyone,

JMM has gone through a lot of changes over the past couple of months, both with JMM itself and as you might of noticed, the website as well. Before I go into detail about the new website and other changes lets talk about the new version of JMM!

With each release, we'll cover a few of the new additions or changes but for a complete listing, check out the changelog.
Nakamori, the JMM Plugin for Kodi

The biggest change with Version 3.4.6.4 is the long awaited addition of Kodi support with the Nakamori Plugin! This was made possible by BigRetroMike, a member of our community who developed and maintains the Nakamori plugin. For installing instructions and general Nakamori usage check out the Nakamori documentation by clicking on Documentation in the above menu and selecting Nakamori. BigRetroMike is always looking for feedback on how to improve Nakamori so if you find anything wrong with it or would like to see a feature added, head over to the Nakamori Github page.
Hashing Speed Fix

There's been a lot of discussion over the past couple of months over JMM's hashing speed, with Version 3.4.6.4 this discussion can be put to rest as hashing speeds have been improved.

Here are some examples of the previous hashing speed.
