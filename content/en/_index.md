Incredibly Easy To Use

||ContentBlock||

We're not kidding when we say we designed Shoko to be as easy to use as possible. What's the point of removing the tedious processes other cataloging programs make you do if we just add our own? Of course, we also provide a ton of options for advanced users allowing each user to have their desired setup.

How Does Shoko Really Work?

||ContentBlock||

Shoko hashes each file in your collection and sends the hash to AniDB for comparison. When a match is found, the series is created in your database and metadata from supported data gathering sites is downloaded and compiled for use within Shoko providing detailed information about each file and its associated series. In the rare chance there ever is a problem with the automated process, Shoko includes a wide array of advanced tools to identify and properly catalog any file that was unable to be automatically processed.
