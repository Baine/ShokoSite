Shoko Version 3.9.7 is now available for download!

We've been hard at on some of the items we previously mentioned in [What's Next For Shoko](https://shokoanime.com/blog/whats-next-for-shoko/) and wanted to release this feature packed release as it might be awhile before the next release.

This release contains many fixes and improvements to the AniDB system, TvDB System and TvDB image downloading. We've also tweaked the Sentry settings to stop it from spamming the logs.

The Web UI also got some much needed TLC and users are now able to pause, start and cancel queues.
