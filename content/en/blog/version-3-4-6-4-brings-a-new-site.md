Hello Everyone,

JMM has gone through a lot of changes over the past couple of months,
both with JMM itself and as you might of noticed, the website as well.
Before I go into detail about the new website and other changes lets
talk about the new version of JMM\!

With each release, we'll cover a few of the new additions or changes but
for a complete listing, check out the
[changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog).

### Nakamori, the JMM Plugin for Kodi

The biggest change with Version 3.4.6.4 is the long awaited addition of
Kodi support with the Nakamori Plugin\! This was made possible by
BigRetroMike, a member of our community who developed and maintains the
Nakamori plugin. For installing instructions and general Nakamori usage
check out the Nakamori documentation by clicking on Documentation in the
above menu and selecting Nakamori. BigRetroMike is always looking for
feedback on how to improve Nakamori so if you find anything wrong with
it or would like to see a feature added, head over to the {{% external-link link="https://github.com/bigretromike/nakamoriplugin/issues" text="Nakamori Github Repo" %}}
