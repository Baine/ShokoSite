We've released a maintenance update for JMM, version 3.6.0.3 that fixes JMM Server and Desktop crashing that was reported shortly after the release of 3.6.0.2. Just goes to show that even with a month long public beta and rigorous internal testing all it takes is that one unique setup to present us with a bug we never encountered.

Download links have been updated, you can also check the changelog for additional information.
