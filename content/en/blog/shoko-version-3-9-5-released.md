Shoko Version 3.9.5 is now available for download!

This release addresses various bugs reported since the last update that we felt needed addressing while we continue working on the next major version of Shoko. As always you can find a summary of the changes made by checking out the Changelog.

### What's Next For Shoko

We get asked quite often what's being worked on at the moment or when a certain feature that's been mentioned before will be released. So in order to somewhat answer these questions and just outline our general plans to the community, we'll be posting a road map of sorts later this week. If there's something in particular you've seen mentioned before but haven't heard about in awhile, DM **Elemental Crisis** for a possible update.
