    <h5>Your Anime In One Place, Accessible Anywhere</h5>
    <p>Shoko server is the core component of the Shoko suite and with it’s client-server architecture which allows any program or plugin to access Shoko.
    You’ll have access to your entire collection locally and over the internet with no additional work outside the initial configuration required.</p>
    <h5>Why A Client-Server Architecture Design?</h5>
    <p>The idea behind Shoko Server is to automate the entire process from start to finish, all you need to do is specify the location of your files and Shoko Server
    does the rest. However, instead of having to duplicate this process, Shoko Server was designed to allow other programs and plugins to connect directly to it, retrieve
    the information it needs and display it as requested. Anyone with programming knowledge can take advantage of this and create their own program and plugin without
    having to worry about all the tedious things Shoko Server takes care of.</p>
  features:
  - icon: fas fa-server fa-sm
    title: Hash Matching
    text: Shoko doesn't rely on the your files having a specific filename structure. Instead, files are hashed and sent to AniDB for comparison and matching.
  - icon: fas fa-file-download fa-sm
    title: Info Downloading
    text: Manually inputting series information is a pain, Shoko automatically downloads and updates all series information in your collection.
  - icon: fas fa-database fa-sm
    title: Centralized DB
    text: Shoko uses a single SQLite database to manage your collection regardless of where the actual physical files are located.
  - icon: fas fa-tv fa-sm
    title: HTPC Support
    text: Plugins for the most popular HTPC programs are available allowing you to combine Shoko with your preferred HTPC program.
